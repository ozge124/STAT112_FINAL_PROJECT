# Introduction to Data Processing and Data Visualization (STAT112) Final Project 
This repository contains the final project for the STAT112 course. The aim is to utilize Python programming language and its libraries, such as **NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib,and Seaborn** to clean, analyze, and visualize a dataset provided by the statistics department at METU.

## Data Description & Project Objectives:
In this project, we worked on a bank marketing dataset. The project required to apply data cleaning and tidying process up to the final interpretation to obtain statistical inference on this dataset. The workflow of this project is divided into three parts to make a comprehensive analysis.

**A. Data Description**

The dataset contains a retail bank's outbound marketing campaigns data, covering the period **2017–2025**. It contains **1,730 observations** with **17 features**, where each row represents a customer contact. The primary goal to analyze these observations to predict the binary target variable subscribed_term_deposit (**1 = customer subscribed to a term deposit after the campaign contact; 0 = did not subscribe.**).

**B. Project Workflow**

**1.Data Cleaning & Tidying:** Utilizing NumPy and Pandas to manipulate, aggregiate, and apply statistical operations on raw data. This included:

* Handling missing values and inconsistencies.

* Standardizing column names and correcting data types.

* Structiring data tidying principles to ensure every row represented a single observation.


**2.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Conducting statistical examination of the dataset before visualizing. This included:

* Calculating summary statistics (mean, median, max, min) to detect extreme values.
* Identifiying relationships between variables to obtain initial inference.

**3.Data Visualization:** Visualizing statistical findings into insightful charts. This included:
* Interpretative charts that answer the research questions.
* Highlight tendencies and patterns that are not obvious in tabular data.
